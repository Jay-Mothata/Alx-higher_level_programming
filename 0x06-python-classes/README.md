Python - Classes and Objects

Description - This project provides a brief overview of Python classes and objects. Understanding classes and objects is fundamental to object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes, and they encapsulate data and behavior. Using classes and objects, you can model real-world entities and their interactions in your code.
A class is defined using the `class` keyword. It serves as a template for creating objects. Classes can have attributes (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on those attributes.
