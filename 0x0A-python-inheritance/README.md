Python - Inheritance

## Overview

Inheritance is a powerful feature in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class. In Python, inheritance enables you to create a new class (subclass) that is based on an existing class (superclass), thereby promoting code reuse and facilitating the creation of more specialized classes.

## How Inheritance Works

In Python, inheritance is achieved by specifying the superclass(es) inside parentheses after the class name when defining a new class. The syntax for creating a subclass is as follows:

```python
class SubClassName(SuperClassName):
    # class body

## Conclusion 

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Python that promotes code reuse and helps in building a hierarchical structure of classes. By leveraging inheritance, you can create more maintainable, modular, and extensible code.
