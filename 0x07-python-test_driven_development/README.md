Python - Test-driven development

Description - Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development approach where you write tests for your code before you actually write the code itself. TDD helps improve code quality by ensuring that your code does what it's supposed to do and continues to do so as it evolves. It also encourages writing modular, testable code and provides a safety net for making changes without introducing bugs.

This project is a collection of Python scripts developed to accomplish TDD. It adheres to specific coding standards, includes comprehensive test cases, and follows best practices for documentation.
